# Starter code is takem from "The Web Developer Bootcamp 2022" by Colt Steele

# Improvements I've made:
- removed original card containing the image
- added a new card and image
- fixed columns allignment on all components using [BULMA](https://bulma.io/) and CSS
- added a random-sized ball, which moves on each player's click within the image figure
- removed the ball on reset
